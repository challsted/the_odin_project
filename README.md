# The Odin Project  

# Phase 1  
I am attempting to go though [The Odin Project][www.theodinproject.com] as a way to get a deeper understanding of Ruby, Rails, and "Web Development" as a whole.  
This repo is for all of the mini-projects they ask me to upload to github, and a way for me to share what I created!
